Multiplayer Quiz application using Python GUI and Socket programming
This Multiplayer Quiz Application is a TCP-based socket program application where the quiz is taken on individual systems connected through a single network. This application are highly useful in conducting online quizzes that frequently evaluates classroom based assessments such as cyclic tests. The application proves its efficiency by cutting down the cost of paper and printing. A lot of time is saved here as there is no need for the teachers to check and correct each paper. The evaluation in this application is fully automated and instant. The leaderboard that is shown at the end of each exam is highly useful for the Participants for their self-evaluation. Administrative control of the whole system is provided by the server application.
The application is developed to program using sockets in a distributed computing environment based on the basic Client-Server model. The coding was done using Python and the GUI was built using socket-based TCP. Demonstration of the principles and concepts of socket programming was done in this project. The socket libraries available in python were also learned and implemented.
